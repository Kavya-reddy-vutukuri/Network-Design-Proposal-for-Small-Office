# Network Design Proposal for Small Office

This proposal outlines a small office network design consisting of 4 departments: HR, ADMIN, I.T, and MARKETING. The network is connected to the internet via a DSL connection provided by the service provider cloud. The company router is assigned an IP address via DHCP by the service provider cloud.

The network is composed of several devices, including a router, a switch, a wireless access point, PCs, VoIP phones, printers, and a file server. These devices are all assigned IP addresses by the router via DHCP. The network is preconfigured to allow these devices to ping the Google DNS server at 8.8.8.8.

The router serves as the gateway for the network, allowing all devices to connect to the internet via the DSL connection provided by the service provider cloud. The switch is used to connect all devices on the network together, allowing them to communicate with one another. The wireless access point provides wireless connectivity to the network for devices such as smartphones and tablets.

The PCs are used by employees in the HR, ADMIN, I.T, and MARKETING departments to access the internet and company resources such as the file server and printers. The VoIP phones are used by employees in the HR and ADMIN departments to communicate with one another.

The printers are shared resources that can be accessed by every employee in the company, allowing them to print documents as needed. The file server is used to store and share files among employees in the company. All employees can access the file server from anywhere in the network, provided they have the necessary username and password credentials.

In summary, this small office network design consists of a router, a switch, a wireless access point, PCs, VoIP phones, printers, and a file server. The devices are assigned IP addresses by the router via DHCP and are preconfigured to ping the Google DNS server. The network is connected to the internet via a DSL connection provided by the service provider cloud, and the router serves as the gateway for the network.
The project outlines the steps involved in structure network design and deployment for a small office home office need. It presents the steps (or phases) of a structured network design and demonstrates a practical implementation of the steps using a real-life case study. The design will first be simulated using Cisco Packet Tracerâ„¢. Specifically, the project will demonstrate first hand, how a small network may be set up using the five phases beginning with the needs analysis and ending with deployment/testing.
